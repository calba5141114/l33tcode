class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        # strings reperesent non-negative integers
        # converting the strings to integers multiplying 
        # the results of those functions I multiply them 
        # and return the product of that operation
            return str(int(num1) * int(num2))
